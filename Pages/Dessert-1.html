        <ul>
          <li>2 cups strong black coffee</li>

        <h3><b>How to Make Tiramisu:</b></h3>
        <dl>
          <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Pour coffee and marsala into a shallow dish or baking dish. Set
            aside.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>

          <dd>
            Beat egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl with electric beaters until
            pale and thick. Add the mascarpone and whipped cream, <br />mixing
            gently until just combined.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>

          <dd>
            Beat egg whites in a medium bowl with electric beaters until soft
            peaks form. Using a large metal spoon, gently fold eggwhites into
            <br />the mascarpone mixture.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>

          <dd>
            Dip enough sponge finger biscuits into the coffee mixture to cover
            the base of a 19cm square ceramic dish. Cover the biscuits with
            one-third of the mascarpone mixture. Repeat layers 2 times, ending
            with the cream. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least
            2 hours. Dust generously with cocoa powder and serve.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Recipe notes</h3>
        <p>
          As it contains raw eggs (in the form of raw egg yolks and egg whites,
          separated) and dairy (including the whipping cream and mascarpone
          mixture), this tiramisu needs to be refrigerated and consumed within
          three days. Because of the raw egg yolks (we use three egg yolks in
          our egg yolk mixture and whip the egg whites separately) and the
          inclusion of marsala wine, often those who are pregnant prefer to
          avoid tiramisu and choose not to eat raw eggs. If you're in doubt
          about whether eating raw eggs is safe during pregnancy, consult your
          GP.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I freeze tiramisu?</h3>
        <p>
          You can freeze this tiramisu recipe for up to three months. Cover the
          top mascarpone mixture and whipped cream layer with several layers
          <br />of plastic wrap and place in the freezer. Defrost in the fridge
          (for food safety reasons, we don't want raw eggs, both egg yolks and
          egg whites,
          <br />
          sitting at room temperature) before serving.
