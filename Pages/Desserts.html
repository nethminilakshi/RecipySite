            Since when does a cake have to be completely homemade for it to be
            something to brag about? Yes, this cake is made with both a boxed
            brownie mix and a boxed cake mix, but don’t let that fool you into
            thinking this cake is anything but decadent. It is one of my most
            popular cakes for a reason.

              Cakes travel best in a cool environment, so bundle up extra if
              it’s a long car ride. If your interior temperature is too warm,
              the frosting could melt and slide down the cake. You can also
              place ice packs around the base of a box if you chose the box
              method.</span

            treat for a crisp fall day. The batter comes together in one bowl,
            and it bakes up into a moist, tender cake that’s delicious for
            dessert, breakfast, or an afternoon snack. It’s packed with fresh
            apples, and brown sugar and cinnamon fill it with rich, spiced
            flavor. On a gray afternoon, nothing lifts my spirits like a slice
            of this apple cake.
