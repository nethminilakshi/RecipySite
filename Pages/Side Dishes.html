            Side dishes are an essential part of a meal, complementing the main
            course and enhancing the overall dining experience. They can range
            from simple salads and steamed vegetables to more elaborate options
            like creamy mashed potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts, or seasoned
            rice. A good side dish not only adds flavor and variety but also
            helps balance the meal by incorporating different textures and
            nutrients. Whether it's a crisp coleslaw with a barbecue meal,
            garlic bread served alongside pasta, or a tangy pickle with an
            Indian curry, side dishes play a crucial role in elevating the taste
            and presentation of any cuisine.

                  Naan bread is a type of leavened, oven-baked flatbread that is
                  popular in South Asian cuisine, particularly in India,
                  Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. Made from a dough of
                  flour, water, yogurt, yeast, and sometimes milk, naan is
                  typically cooked in a traditional clay oven called a tandoor,
                  which gives it a distinctive smoky flavor and soft, slightly
                  chewy texture. The bread often has a slightly charred, crispy
                  exterior and a fluffy interior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Naan can be enjoyed plain or topped with various ingredients
                  such as garlic, butter, cheese, or herbs. It is commonly
                  served as a side dish alongside curries, kebabs, or lentils,
                  and can be used to scoop up sauces or wraps for various
                  fillings.

                <h3><b>How to Make Naan Bread:</b></h3>
                <dl>
                  <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
                  <dd>
                    Put 125ml warm water into a bowl and sprinkle over the yeast
                    and 1 tsp of the sugar. Leave for 10-15 mins or until
                    frothy. In a larger bowl, put the <br />flour, remaining
                    sugar, ½ tsp salt and baking powder. Mix together then make
                    a well in the centre in which to pour the melted butter,
                    yogurt, nigella seeds <br />
                    and yeast mixture. Stir well, then start to bring the
                    mixture together with your hands. If it’s very wet add a
                    spoonful of flour but if it’s dry add a splash more
                    <br />warm water. It should be a very soft dough but not so
                    wet that it won’t come together into a ball.
                  </dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>

                  <dd>
                    When you’re happy with the consistency, start kneading,
                    first in the bowl, then transfer the mixture onto a
                    well-floured surface and continue
                    <br />to knead for 10 mins or until smooth and elastic but
                    still soft. Butter a large bowl, then shape the dough into a
                    ball and place in the prepared bowl. <br />Cover and leave
                    in a warm place for about 1 hr or until doubled in size.
                  </dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
                  <dd>
                    Divide the dough into six balls and put them on a baking
                    tray dusted with flour, then cover the tray with a damp tea
                    towel. Heat a large non-stick frying <br />pan over a high
                    heat. Take one of the balls of dough and roll it out to form
                    a teardrop shape that’s approximately 21cm long and around
                    13cm at the <br />widest part. When the pan is very hot,
                    carefully lay the naan bread into it. Let it dry fry and
                    puff up for about 3 mins, then turn over and cook on the
                    other <br />side for another 3-4 mins or until cooked
                    through and charred in patches.
                  </dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>

                  <dd>
                    Heat the oven to its lowest setting and put the cooked naan
                    bread on a baking sheet. Brush with a little melted butter
                    and cover with foil. Keep warm in the oven <br />and layer
                    up the cooked naans one on top of each other as you make
                    them, brushing each one with melted butter or ghee as you
                    go. Serve warm with curry or dips.
